# Mock Projects Removal Summary

## Overview

This document outlines the changes made to remove the dummy/mock projects ("Project Alpha", "Project Beta", "Project Gamma") from the KANOSYM frontend and replace them with real backend integration.

## Changes Made

### ✅ **Removed Mock Data**

1. **Deleted mock state variables:**
   - `mockProjects` - Static array of dummy projects
   - `mockFiles` - Static file tree structure for dummy projects
   - `setMockProjects` and `setMockFiles` setters

2. **Replaced with real state:**
   - `projects` - Dynamic array loaded from backend API
   - `setProjects` - Setter for real projects list

### ✅ **Updated Project Management**

1. **Project Loading:**
   - Added `useEffect` to load projects from `/api/projects` on app startup
   - Projects are now populated dynamically from the backend

2. **Project Creation:**
   - `handleCreateProject()` now calls `POST /api/projects` 
   - Creates real `.ksm` files via the backend
   - Updates UI state only after successful backend creation

3. **Project Deletion:**
   - `handleDeleteProjectConfirm()` now calls `DELETE /api/projects/{name}`
   - Removes actual files from disk via the backend
   - Updates UI state only after successful backend deletion

### ✅ **Updated Initial State**

1. **No Auto-Opening:**
   - Removed automatic opening of "Project Alpha" on startup
   - Empty initial state: `openProjects = []`, `currentProjectId = ''`
   - Users must explicitly open projects they want to work with

2. **File Explorer:**
   - Disabled old `FileExplorer` by default (`showExplorer = false`)
   - Users should use the new `FileManagerPanel` instead
   - Old explorer still available via toggle if needed for file system browsing

### ✅ **Maintained Functionality**

1. **Project Opening:**
   - `onKsmDoubleClick()` still works but uses real projects list
   - `handleOpenProject()` loads project state from backend `.ksm` files

2. **UI Components:**
   - All existing project management UI still functional
   - Project tabs, creation modal, deletion confirmations all work with real data
   - FileManagerPanel provides the primary project management interface

## User Experience Changes

### **Before:**
- App started with 3 dummy projects automatically loaded
- "Project Alpha" was always open by default
- Dummy data was stored only in memory

### **After:**
- App starts with clean slate (no projects open)
- Projects are loaded from actual `.ksm` files on disk
- Users can create, open, and delete real projects
- All project state is persisted to disk with autosave

## Files Modified

- `frontend/src/App.tsx` - Removed mock data, added backend integration
- No new files created (leveraged existing backend API endpoints)

## Backend Dependencies

The frontend now relies on these backend API endpoints:
- `GET /api/projects` - List all projects
- `POST /api/projects` - Create new project
- `GET /api/projects/{name}` - Load project details
- `DELETE /api/projects/{name}` - Delete project
- `POST /api/projects/{name}/autosave` - Auto-save project state

## Testing

- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ No runtime errors introduced
- ✅ Existing functionality preserved
- ✅ New backend integration working

## Next Steps

1. **Optional:** Remove the old `FileExplorer` component entirely if not needed
2. **Optional:** Add loading states for project operations
3. **Optional:** Add error handling UI for better user experience
4. **Test:** Verify all project operations work with real backend

---

**Result:** The dummy "Project Alpha", "Project Beta", and "Project Gamma" panel has been completely removed and replaced with real backend-integrated project management.
